# AI Safety Manifest - Genesis Sparse Worktree
# This workspace has restricted visibility to prevent AI contamination

Worktree: vertex-datastore
Focus: modules/vertex-datastore/
Files:       17/60
Branch: sparse-vertex-datastore
Created: 2025-10-08T12:03:58Z

AI Safety Rules:
1. Only modify files within focus paths: modules/vertex-datastore/
2. File limit enforced: 60 maximum
3. No deep directory nesting (max 3 levels)
4. No imports from outside this worktree
5. Use Genesis smart-commit for quality gates

For other work areas, create separate sparse worktrees.
