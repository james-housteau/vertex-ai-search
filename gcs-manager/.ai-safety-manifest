AI Safety Rules:
1. Only modify files within focus paths: modules/gcs-manager/
2. File limit enforced: 60 maximum
3. No deep directory nesting (max 3 levels)
4. No imports from outside this worktree
5. Use Genesis smart-commit for quality gates

For other work areas, create separate sparse worktrees.
