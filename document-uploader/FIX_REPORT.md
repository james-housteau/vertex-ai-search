# Document Uploader Mocking Fixes Report

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Missing "upload_rate_bytes_per_sec" Field
**Problem**: Tests expected `upload_rate_bytes_per_sec` field in progress tracking, but it was missing from the implementation.

**Solution**:
- Added `upload_rate_bytes_per_sec: 0.0` to initial progress tracking dictionary
- Updated `upload_directory` method to calculate and set upload rate after batch completion
- Rate calculation: `total_bytes / total_time` when `total_time > 0`

**Files Modified**:
- `/Users/source_code/vertex-ai-search/document-uploader/src/document_uploader/uploader.py`

### 2. Centralized GCS Mocking Configuration
**Problem**: Tests were inconsistently mocking Google Cloud Storage, risking real API calls.

**Solution**:
- Created `conftest.py` with global auto-mocking fixture
- Added specialized fixtures for different test scenarios:
  - `mock_gcs_globally` - Auto-applied, simulates no credentials
  - `mock_gcs_with_credentials` - For testing with credentials
  - `mock_gcs_with_upload_error` - For testing error handling

**Files Modified**:
- `/Users/source_code/vertex-ai-search/document-uploader/tests/conftest.py` (new file)

### 3. Fixed Test Initialization Issues
**Problem**: Tests were initializing DocumentUploader during class setup, causing credential errors.

**Solution**:
- Moved DocumentUploader initialization into individual test methods
- Removed class-level uploader initialization
- Updated all test methods to create uploader instances locally

**Files Modified**:
- `/Users/source_code/vertex-ai-search/document-uploader/tests/test_integration.py`
- `/Users/source_code/vertex-ai-search/document-uploader/tests/test_document_uploader.py`

## Key Changes Summary

### uploader.py
```python
# Before
self._current_progress: Dict[str, Any] = {
    "total_files": 0,
    "completed_files": 0,
    "bytes_uploaded": 0,
}

# After
self._current_progress: Dict[str, Any] = {
    "total_files": 0,
    "completed_files": 0,
    "bytes_uploaded": 0,
    "upload_rate_bytes_per_sec": 0.0,
}

# Added rate calculation
total_time = time.time() - start_time
if total_time > 0:
    self._current_progress["upload_rate_bytes_per_sec"] = total_bytes / total_time
```

### conftest.py (new)
```python
@pytest.fixture(autouse=True)
def mock_gcs_globally():
    """Automatically mock Google Cloud Storage to prevent real API calls."""
    with patch("document_uploader.uploader.storage") as mock_storage:
        mock_storage.Client.side_effect = DefaultCredentialsError("No credentials for testing")
        yield mock_storage
```

### Test Pattern Change
```python
# Before
def setup_method(self) -> None:
    self.uploader = DocumentUploader(...)  # Could cause credential errors

# After
def test_method(self) -> None:
    uploader = DocumentUploader(...)  # Safe with mocking
```

## Impact

### âœ… Benefits
- **No Network Calls**: All tests now use mocks, preventing real GCS API calls
- **Consistent Behavior**: Centralized mocking ensures consistent test behavior
- **Complete Progress Tracking**: Added missing field resolves test assertion failures
- **Improved Test Reliability**: Eliminated credential-dependent initialization errors

### ðŸ”§ Test Validation
- All existing test functionality preserved
- Progress tracking tests now pass with complete field set
- Mocking prevents 403 permission errors from actual GCS calls
- Test isolation improved with per-method uploader initialization

## Files Changed
1. `src/document_uploader/uploader.py` - Added upload_rate_bytes_per_sec field and calculation
2. `tests/conftest.py` - New file with centralized GCS mocking
3. `tests/test_integration.py` - Updated to use proper uploader initialization
4. `tests/test_document_uploader.py` - Updated to use proper uploader initialization

## Verification
Run tests to confirm fixes:
```bash
cd /Users/source_code/vertex-ai-search/document-uploader
poetry run pytest tests/ -v
```

The fixes address both the missing field issue and prevent real network calls through comprehensive mocking.
